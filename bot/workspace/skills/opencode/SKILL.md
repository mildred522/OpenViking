Use helper scripts to manage your OpenCode (ClawCode) instances.

## Helper Scripts

```bash
uv run python skills/opencode/script_name.py
```

Note: Do not kill the opencode process.

## Scripts

Listing all OpenCode sessions

Example:
uv run python skills/opencode/list_sessions.py


### `list_messages_of_session.py`
Listing latest OpenCode messages by session_id 

Example:
uv run python skills/opencode/list_sessions.py {session_id}

## Session Status Types

- **🟢 WAITING**: Last message was from user - agent is waiting for input
- **🔴 WORKING**: Last message was from assistant - agent recently finished or may be working
- **🟡 UNKNOWN**: Cannot determine status
